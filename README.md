Additionally, inventory turnover is uneven across categories,and regions leading to overstock in some areas and missed sales opportunities in others. The business needs a data-driven strategy to better understand customer behavior, optimize inventory, and increase lifetime customer value.

- Analyze Sales Channels Effectiveness: Compare performance across online and in-store channels to understand differences in average order value, conversion rates, and customer demographics.
